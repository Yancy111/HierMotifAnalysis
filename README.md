# HierMotifAnalysis
This is my undergraduate graduation project supervised by Professor Chen of Zhejiang University. 

This work performs community detection using Louvain on weighted networks, whose weights are calculated using cosine or Jaccard similarity. Then i also ran MODET on hierarchical networks produced in community detection to count 3-node/4-node motif.
